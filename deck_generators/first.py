"""
CARD drawn in a game is a function of the total global bias and some probabilities

BIAS cards appear with a constant probability of 0.25 throughout the game
For the remaining 0.75, we have two choices :
    a. with a probability of tgb/MAX_TGB, draw a card containing FAKE AFFINITY NEWS  or FAKE TOPICAL news
    b. with a probability of (1 - tgb/MAX_TGB), draw a card containing TRUE AFFINITY NEWS or TRUE TOPICAL news
